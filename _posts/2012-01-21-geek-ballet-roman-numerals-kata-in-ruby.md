For a while now I've been a fan of code kata screencasts set to music. The musical accompaniment accentuates how beautiful code can be, and frames it to be appreciated as an artistic endeavor, even though it is still a logical exercise. I think of it as geek ballet. <a href="http://coreyhaines.com" target="_blank">Corey Haines</a> first introduced me to this art form, and he recently encouraged me to try one of my own, so here it is. It was more work than I expected, but it was good fun, and I learned a lot. In the same way that writing about any subject forces you to understand it better, demonstrating how to practice forces you to practice more.

In this video I'm using Ruby with RSpec, AutoTest, and Growl notifications. The music is the fourth movement of my favorite symphony, Dvorak's 9th in E minor.

Enjoy.
