Most of my developer friends who have achieved any amount of public recognition or notoriety have reported experiencing some measure of [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). They feel that they have garnered a reputation that surpasses their actual level of competence and contribution. It always brings me great comfort to hear this, because I feel the same way. Or am I just pretending so that I'll feel more like one of them? üòâ

Well, I recently went beyond the syndrome and proved myself an actual impostor, a fraud, a phony. A plagiarist, to be specific. One evening last month I was sitting at home doing something useless on my laptop when my eldest spawn told me a geeky math joke. I thought it was very clever. I thought my geeky friends would appreciate it as well. So I tweeted it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Fibonacci joke is as bad as the last two you heard combined.</p>&mdash; Calvin Bottoms (@calvinb) <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinb/status/907794337492332544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

The next morning I awoke to a deluge of notifications of responses, likes, and retweets beyond anything I've ever experienced on Twitter. This tweet had taken flight for some reason. I got replies from some of my geek heroes who neither know me nor follow me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have a feeling the next one will be at least as bad again.</p>&mdash; Dan North (@tastapod) <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod/status/907998170847830017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

I was at work when I saw the notification that I had been retweeted by Australian comedian [Tim Minchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Minchin).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh yes. <a href="https://t.co/pS1YPyKcBj">https://t.co/pS1YPyKcBj</a></p>&mdash; Tim Minchin (@timminchin) <a href="https://twitter.com/timminchin/status/908043745316057088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2017</a></blockquote>

What was happening? I guess it was my twenty minutes of Twitter fame. I started looking through the responses. One that caught my eye (and my stomach) was addressed to [@sigfpe](https://twitter.com/sigfpe) and said simply,

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congrats on getting your tweet stolen <a href="https://t.co/3D2WriOhAK">https://t.co/3D2WriOhAK</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Lin (@quasicoherence) <a href="https://twitter.com/quasicoherence/status/908134907251183617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2017</a></blockquote>

Oh, no. I had stolen this man's tweet. In retrospect I suppose I could have googled the joke so I could attribute it properly, but I wasn't writing a research paper, and I had no idea anyone other than my geeky friends would even see it. I composed a quick explanation/apology tweet to [@sigfpe](https://twitter.com/sigfpe), confessing that I owed him a large number of retweets. It was one those times that 140 characters did not feel like enough, but he could not have been more gracious about it, and I am very grateful.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If your kid told you it that makes my day üòÅ</p>&mdash; Dan Piponi (@sigfpe) <a href="https://twitter.com/sigfpe/status/908179972610605056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2017</a></blockquote>

Such social media points mean nothing to some people but an awful lot to others, and I had just collected someone else's jackpot. So [@sigfpe](https://twitter.com/sigfpe), thank you for being so cool about this whole thing and seeing it for the inadvertent act that it was. I really liked your joke, and I clearly am not alone.

Man, Twitter is kind of frightening. It's fortunate that important people don't use it to talk about real things.
