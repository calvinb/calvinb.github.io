I just got done with [Nodevember](http://nodevember.org/) 2016, where I saw some great talks, caught up with some old friends, and made some new ones. I also had a fun time hanging out in person with some of my [LeanKit](https://www.leankit.com) co-workers who work remotely, and I work with the greatest people in the world, so that's always wonderful. I had the privilege of presenting a new talk I called "Arts and Sciences: Programming Music on the Web." I had a fabulous crowd who were so onboard and engaged, and they made it so much fun! If you were there, thank you for making it such a blast!

The slides for my talk are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XRB9_aLJa-hV9CKE60cQt4_vfQAFw_iaGK5H9P8jWpE), and you can find the "Beep Boop" BASIC code I showed at https://github.com/calvinb/beep-boop.

In case you're interested in the recordings of the early computer music demos I mentioned, here are the links:

* [Turing and Strachey 1951](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/first-recording-computer-generated-music-created-alan-turing-restored-enigma-code)
* [Dompier, Altair 8800b "Fool on the Hill" 1975](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgYhVnmeWrk)

Go build something fun!
