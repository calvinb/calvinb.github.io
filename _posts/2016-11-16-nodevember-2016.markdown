<p>I just got done with <a href="http://nodevember.org/">Nodevember</a> 2016, where I saw some great talks, caught up with some old friends, and made some new ones. I also had a fun time hanging out in person with some of my <a href="https://www.leankit.com">LeanKit</a> co-workers who work remotely, and I work with the greatest people in the world, so that's always wonderful. I had the privilege of presenting a new talk I called &quot;Arts and Sciences: Programming Music on the Web.&quot; I had a fabulous crowd who were so onboard and engaged, and they made it so much fun! If you were there, thank you for making it such a blast!</p>
