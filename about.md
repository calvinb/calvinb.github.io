I am a husband, father, musician, and software geek with functional tendencies.
I like languages. I enjoy tinkering with Haskell, Elixir, Elm, and such.
I am fortunate to work with a small and brilliant team at
<a href="https://hcahealthcare.com" target="_blank">HCA</a>
in Nashville, Tennessee, creating cool and exciting things with Elixir.
I play keyboards in the awesome Beatles band cover band

Sometimes I speak. Sometimes I write. Most times I code.
