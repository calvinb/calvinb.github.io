I am a husband, father, musician, and software geek with functional tendencies.
I like languages. I enjoy tinkering with Haskell, Elixir, Elm, and such.
As a grateful member of the mighty [LeanKit](https://leankit.com/) web team in Franklin, Tennessee, I work mostly with Node.js, with a little C# just to keep me grounded.
Sometimes I speak. Sometimes I write. Most times I code.
