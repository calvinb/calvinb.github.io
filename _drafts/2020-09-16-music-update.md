title:  Music Update
---
Hey, I'm trying to step away from social media, which has reminded me that I have
this blog. My musical life has picked up a bit in the last couple of years, and I
thought I would throw out an update here just for fun.

In early 2018 I started playing keyboards in a Beatles cover band called
<a href="https://theenglishrain.com" target="_blank">The English Rain</a>.
Sorry to brag, but these guys are really good, and I work hard to keep up with them.
No, we don't dress up in wigs and suits; we just try to recreate the sound as
faithfully as possible. We usually have a regular monthly outdoor gig in downtown
Franklin through the summer, but this year, for obvious reasons, we did not.

To keep ourselves entertained during the lockdown, we made a few quarantine home
videos of some of our favorite 70s and 80s tunes. We used the name
"The Shut-Inz" so people wouldn't think The English Rain had given up on The Beatles.
Yes, I am trying to avoid social media, but you can see these videos on our
<a href="https://facebook.com/theenglishrain" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>
and/or our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSOWwr1ngWQl-FH_3e4pKiw/" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.
The sound is better on YouTube, but on Facebook there are some live stream replays
as well if you're into that kind of thing.

Since this is offically a software blog, I'll mention that I have done a good bit
of coding for my laptop-based keyboard rig. Sometimes I don't have quite enough hands
to cover all the parts and have to use a little magic.
Maybe I'll write more about that later.

I have also been playing keyboards with a theme-driven band called
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedecadesbandnashville/" target="_blank">The Decades</a>.
They are a talented bunch of twenty-somethings with inexplicably good taste in music.
This is the least efficient band possible; so far each gig has had a completely
different set list, hardly ever recycling anything.
It's a lot of work, but it never gets boring. Thus far we have done:

- 70s and 80s Classic Rock
- 90s Radio Pop
- Christmas Tunes
- Country Originals
- Disco!
- Movie Songs

These band endeavors have also led to the opportunity for me to do a little session work,
which I have not done in many, many years. I am very fortunate at my age to be still
learning and growing in the things that I love.
